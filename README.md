# CompilerLab
A program for Calculation
The program will ask the user to input a value (say n).

Then the user will input n lines of input each of which contains an identifier and its corresponding value.
Then program will ask the user again to input a value (say m).
Then user will input m lines of expressions.

This Program calculates the final value for each of the given expression using first n lines of input. 

If it can't evaluate any expression from given numbers of identifiers then output 'Compilation Error'. 

Allowed mathematical operators are +(add), -(subtract), x(multiply), /(divide).
